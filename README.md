This is work in progress. You can already try it out and if you decide to do so, please notify me about any mistakes/bugs you find.

If you dowload the project, the easiest is to just open start_app.R in RStudio, highlight everything and press run. This should open a new window in your standard browser containing the interactive notebook.

You can also check out the binder version: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/enweg/SnT_VARS/main?urlpath=shiny/App/)

> :warning: Providing your own data sometimes seems to cause an error when the link above is used!

> :info: It the file gives you an initial error, but still shows that you can select variables, then just delete one of the variables and add it back in. This often solves the intial start-up error. I will try to figure out how to prevent this error. If you have any suggestions, please let me know.

If you want to provide your own data, you can open a RStudio session on mybinder.org, open the start_app.R file, highlight everything, and press run. This will again open a new tab with the interactive notebook. In this version you should also be able to provide your own data.
