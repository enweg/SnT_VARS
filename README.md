This is work in progress. You can already try it out and if you decide to do so, please notify me about any mistakes/bugs you find.

If you dowload the project, the easiest is to just open start_app.R in RStudio, highlight everything and press run. This should open a new window in your standard browser containing the interactive notebook.

You can also check out the binder version: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/enweg/SnT_VARS/main?urlpath=shiny/App/)

> :warning: Providing your own data does not work using the link above!

If you want to provide your own data, you can open a RStudio session on mybinder.org, open the start_app.R file, highlight everything, and press run. This will again open a new tab with the interactive notebook. In this version you should also be able to provide your own data.
