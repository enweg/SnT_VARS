This is work in progress. You can already try it out and if you decide to do so, please notify me about any mistakes/bugs you find.

If you dowload the project, the easiest is to just open start_app.R in RStudio, highlight everything and press run. This should open a new window in your standard browser containing the interactive notebook.

You can also check out the binder version: Coming soon!
